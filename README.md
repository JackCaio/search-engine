# Search Engine

## About

Full stack system that searches for products from MercadoLibre's and Buscape's databases, based on the filters the user chooses with price, category, and a button to see the product in the original shop

## Stacks

- Front End: ReactJS

- Back End: ExpressJS, Axios, Cheerio

- Database: WIP

## Issues

- Missing database implementation. Database should keep the search results, so that once the user remakes the same search, it doesn't take so long.
- Backend: Fetch all Buscape products. Search should bring all Buscape products, not just the first pages ones.
- Frontend: Add styling and a paging system.
